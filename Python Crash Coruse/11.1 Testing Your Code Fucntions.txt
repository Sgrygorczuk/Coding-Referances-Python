#NExt you have to take approatate action in this case make the middle name optional by chaning the FormatedName inputs

#There is a lot of asser methods you can use 
#assertEqual(a, b) Verify that a == b

#assertIn(item, list) Verify that item is in list
#assertNotIn(item, list) Verify that item is not in list
