#You can print out the addion subtraction mulcipalce or even division of numbers
#in this case we are dealing with integers which dont have decimal points 
print(4+2)
print(4-2)
print(4*2)
print(4/2)

#To uses exponsnets you just use the ** 
print(4**2)

#It even has order of operations integrated 
print(((4+2*3)**2)/4)

#anything that has a decimal point is a float and you can use math rules on it same as an integer 
print(0.4+0.2)
print(0.4-0.2)
print(0.4*0.2)
print(0.4/0.2)

#You can even make ints or floats into variables by assinging them name 
number = 23;
print(number)

#however you cannot mix strings and int/floats when priting, they are two diffrent data types and 
#you need to covernt one to the other using str() and placing the int/float variable into the function 
print("Jason is " + str(number) + " years old\n")

#This allows you to skim throug the idealoigly connected to pythobn
