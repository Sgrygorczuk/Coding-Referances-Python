#Use the following command to run get-pip.py:
#$ python get-pip.py
#If you use a different command to run Python in a terminal, make sure
#you use that command to run get-pip.py. For example, your command might
#be python3 get-pip.py or C:\Python35\python get-pip.py.
#After the program runs, run the command python -m pip --version to
#make sure pip was installed successfully.

#The Pygame project is hosted on a code-sharing site called Bitbucket. To
#install Pygame on your version of Windows, find a Windows installer at
#https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame/downloads/ that matches the version of
#Python you’re running. If you don’t see an appropriate installer listed at
#Bitbucket, check http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame.
#After you’ve downloaded the appropriate file, run the installer if it’s a .exe file.
#If you have a file ending in .whl, copy the file to your project directory.
#Open a command window, navigate to the folder that you copied the
#installer to, and use pip to run the installer:
#> python -m pip install --user pygame-1.9.2a0-cp35-none-win32.whl
